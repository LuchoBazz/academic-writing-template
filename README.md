# **Academic Writing Template (Personal Repository)**

My personal clean and reusable LaTeX template for academic writing, compatible with Overleaf and local LaTeX environments.

## **Overview**

This repository contains a well-structured LaTeX template designed to simplify the creation of academic papers, reports, and manuscripts. It provides a clean layout, organized file structure, and commonly used packages to ensure consistency and professionalism in academic writing.

You can use it directly in **Overleaf** or in your **local LaTeX environment** (TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.).
